I have created a database using faker python library. The dataset is of more than 10,000 rows.
I have hosted the apiCalls using render.
API endpoints - 
https://blacklight-fsco.onrender.com/current-week-leaderboard
https://blacklight-fsco.onrender.com/last-week-leaderboard/<country_code> (The user need to enter the two letter country code in the api call)
https://blacklight-fsco.onrender.com//user-rank/<user_id> (The user needs to enter the user-id from the database)
